# Debugging

## Due: Tue 9/19 at 11:59 PM

- Each program in this repository has at least one error (compilation, runtime, and/or logic)
  - For the programs that say "Use inputs" in a comment, use those inputs when you run the program
- Fix the errors in the program
  - Change as little code as possible
  - Do not make any changes beyond fixing the errors
- Answer the corresponding question in the Schoology assessment describing what was wrong with the program
